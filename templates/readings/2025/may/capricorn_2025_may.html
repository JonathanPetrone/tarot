         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">1. üåÄ 1. The Hermit ‚Äì Current Situation</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">As you find yourself cloaked in the Hermit‚Äôs gentle illumination, a retreat into self-discovery beckons you, Capricorn. This card reflects a month where quiet solitude shall be more of a teacher than the bustling world outside. Seek solace in serene corners, whether they be material or mental, and let them cradle your soul. In this sacred silence, the core of who you are vibrates softly with truth, illuminating your path in the softest of hues. Forging connections with your inner wisdom, you&#39;ll find that guidance comes like whispers in a library of knowledge. The Hermit&#39;s lantern lights the way, carving out a road of introspection that prepares you for coming transformations.</p>
         
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">2. üí≠ 2. Seven of Cups ‚Äì Challenges</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">A splendid masquerade of choices lays at your feet, each cup representing a dazzling yet deceptive promise. The Seven of Cups draws you into a realm of wonder and confusion, urging you to discern fantasy from reality. This month, a cloud of indecision might hang heavy, tempting you with dreams that are beautiful but not always viable. Beware of illusions that lead you astray and foster discernment with the choices you face. It‚Äôs a time to peer beyond the glitter and glamour, using logic as a lantern to slice through the deceptive mist. Clarity will come through patience and intuition, dear Capricorn, dispelling shadows of uncertainty.</p>
         
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">3. üíï 3. Two of Cups ‚Äì Strengths</h3>

         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">4. üîÑ 4. Wheel of Fortune ‚Äì What to Focus On</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Destiny spins its wheel as you stand at the cusp of transformation, Capricorn. The Wheel of Fortune asks you to embrace the cycles of life, surrendering to fate while also directing your own narrative. Trust in the process and adapt to the changes whirling around you with grace and confidence. When fortune manifests with its unpredictability, see it as an opportunity to evolve and redirect your course. Keeping an open mind will help you seize those fortuitous moments, turning potential hurdles into a springboard for success. All is cyclical, and as the wheel turns, your adaptability will be your greatest asset.</p>
         
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">5. ‚öîÔ∏è 5. Two of Swords ‚Äì Past Energy</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">From recent months, you bring with you the energy of the Two of Swords: a past dominated by the stillness of decision-making that may not yet have resolved itself. Caught in the duality, you may have felt torn between intellect and emotion, waiting patiently for clarity. This energy, while now receding, provided a firm foundation for present insights. Now, those blindfolded moments of contemplation transition into a deeper understanding that will guide you through new challenges. Balance achieved in the past becomes your fulcrum for future actions.</p>
         
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">6. üî® 6. Eight of Pentacles ‚Äì Near Future</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Patience and dedication will soon become your guiding forces. The Eight of Pentacles shines its earthy wisdom upon your craftsmanship, heralding a period rich in diligent work and the honing of skills. In the near future, your hands and mind labor together, creating something of lasting virtue. Whether in career, a personal project, or self-improvement, the key to triumph lies in steady, attentive effort. Celebrate progress, and let each small step fuel your determination. The rewards may not be immediate, but their promise gleams like gold beneath the surface.</p>
         
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">7. üåç 7. Three of Wands ‚Äì Advice</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Standing on the shore, gazing towards distant horizons, the Three of Wands ushers in a call for expansive thinking. This card invites you to cast your nets wide, to think globally about your paths and possibilities. Embrace the spirit of exploration and foresight; look beyond the immediate and dare to dream big. With your groundwork solidifying under the Eight of Pentacles, now is the time to advance your grand visions. Seek new opportunities, align with expansive energies, and remain open to collaborations that expand your world. Patience will be your compass as you chart these new waters, trusting in what lies beyond the visible horizon.</p>
         
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">8. üî• 8. The Devil ‚Äì External Influences</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Rather airy wings whisper that temptation and enticements linger in your external surroundings this month. The Devil represents the enchantments of material pleasures and binding commitments that have sown roots around you. Remain vigilant about influences that seek to ensnare or detour your grander plans, reminding you to stay rooted in your values. It&#39;s a time to challenge limiting beliefs and shake free from any shackles that hold you back. Understanding these external forces will free you to choose your path rather than stumble blindly. As such, the power of liberation and self-awareness will be your champions.</p>
         
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">9. üí§ 9. Four of Swords ‚Äì Hopes and Fears</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Heavily intertwined, your hopes for rest dance with the fear of withdrawal embodied by the Four of Swords. You yearn for peace, chasing after a serene refuge amid the chaos. Yet, there lies apprehension in solitude‚Äîthe worry of missing out, of becoming stilled. Trust that rest is not idleness, but a rekindling flame that shall spark renewed vigor. Embrace the solace and reflection, as in these quiet moments, fears dissolve and wisdom awaits.</p>
         
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">10. üéµ 10. Judgement ‚Äì Likely Outcome</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">As May spins to a close, Judgement heralds a spiritual awakening, a renewal that shakes the old foundations loose. Like a gentle crescendo leading to a powerful symphony, it calls for you to rise above, transformed and enlightened by your journey. Through self-assessment and the embracing of your true calling, this card symbolizes the emergence of clarity and purpose. The echoes of past actions reach a resolution, quilting together your story with lessons learned. Welcome this rebirth, where forgiveness interweaves with motion, bringing liberation. Stand ready to respond to this spiritual summons, and you will blaze forward, reborn with clarity and intention.</p>
         
     
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">üåü Madame‚Äôs Final Whisper</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Ah, dear Capricorn, as your reading casts its shadows and light upon your path, may you remember the fierce yet gentle strength within you. Unearth your treasures through reflection, dance with the wheel of fortune&#39;s churn, and embrace every reckoning as a renewal. But while you gaze upon the distant stars, stay mindful of the webbed snares that could tug at your roots. Know that judgement brings a door ajar, waiting for your step towards awakening, offering the promise of clarity and peace. Thus, embrace your inner strength and the beauty of a well-forged path; for within, lies your power to navigate the dance of life with grace and ease.</p>
