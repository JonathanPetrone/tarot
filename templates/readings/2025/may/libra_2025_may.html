    <p class="text-white text-l mb-12 ml-12 mr-12">Ah, Libra, darling child of the scales, May 2025 paints a picture of a tranquil yet transformative month. Your celestial balance is graced by four Major Arcana cards, guiding you through realms of profound change and reflection. The gentle chords of emotional Cups provide a nurturing undercurrent, leading you to embrace the whispers of your heart and the ties that bind you in friendship and love. Yet, stark swords cut through with the necessary clarity, pushing you to release what no longer serves, like leaves carried by an autumn breeze. The notable absence of fiery Wands suggests a time to rest from the hustle, to feel rather than act, allowing the quiet wisdom of stillness to illuminate your path.</p>
