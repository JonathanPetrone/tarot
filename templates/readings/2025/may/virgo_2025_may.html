         <h2 class="text-white text-4xl text-center ml-12 mr-12 mb-12 mt-8">Monthly Reading</h2>
         <p class="text-white text-l mb-12 ml-12 mr-12">🔮 Once more, we enter the realm of earthly logic and whispered winds for the Virgo kin, dear seekers. May brings a canvas stroked with the measured lines and thoughtful breaths of the Minor Arcana, signifying the practical and emotional journey you are set to weave. The Queen of Swords presides over your present, her discerning gaze signifying a month where intellect and clarity reign supreme. Balancing old and new, achievement and solitude, past joys and future aspirations, you dance through May’s tapestry with Cups, Pentacles, and Swords — each element offering its unique melody. No grand drama of the Majors to upheave you this month, yet what unfolds is a profound practice in mastering life’s everyday symphony.</p>
     
         
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">1. 🌀 1. Queen of Swords – Current Situation</h3>
         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">The regal Queen of Swords sits poised at your life&#39;s helm, inviting you to embrace clarity and communication. Her sharp mind is your ally, urging you towards honesty — both with yourself and others. This lady of air hints that now is a time for precision; determine your course with keen vision and articulate your desires without ambiguity. You may find yourself taking decisions swiftly, cutting through confusion as one does a morning mist. It&#39;s her way to help you see the truth in situations, letting no foggy emotion blur your path. Remember, dearest Virgo, intellectual honesty is your guiding star this May.</p>

         <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">The Nine of Pentacles, clad in abundance and self-sufficiency, suggests your solitary achievements might feel both rewarding and isolating this month. Bewildering as it sounds, prosperity can come with the sneaky challenge of isolation, if not balanced with sharing and connection. The comfort of your own garden may lure you into enjoying the fruits of your labor alone. Rejoice in your independence, yet mind the lure of solitary contentment — for true wealth is often found in the community you nurture. Keep those walls you’ve built to protect yourself as gates openable to the warmth of fellowship.</p>

Your strength lies in prudence and stability, the careful management of resources both physical and emotional. In this time, you have the ability to hold on to what is yours, defending your domain with unwavering resolve. However, while clinging tightly can feel secure, consider that generosity is also a form of strength. Allow some boundaries to ease when wisdom dictates; abundance flows where love creates channels, not barriers.</p>

Carry this happiness with you, and let it be a latent reservoir of solace and inspiration.</p>

Understand, dear Virgo, that there is peace to be sought even in closure; what feels like an end could be the unfurling start of liberation. Permit this cycle to complete, trusting in the promise of dawn.</p>
         
         <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">10. 💧 10. Five of Pentacles – Likely Outcome</h3>
