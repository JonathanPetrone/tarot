Like a wise sculptor, you stand poised with tools in hand, ready to carve dreams from stone. The Minor Arcana dominate this month, suggesting life&#39;s rich but tangible details press forward — indeed, a dance of Wands and Pentacles, punctuated by the imagined waters of Cups. These stir creative fires and steady the material realm, even as your singular Major Arcana, The Magician, suggests external sparks of genius are not to be ignored. Amidst the gathering of Twos, signals of balance and decision emerge, while whispering echoes of Tens ring endings and crescendos. May is your mosaic of shifting energies, challenging yet rewarding, as your earthbound spirit ventures into fresh terrains.</p>
