        <h2 class="text-white text-4xl text-center ml-12 mr-12 mb-12 mt-8">Summary Aquarius April 2025 Reading</h2>
        <p class="text-white text-l mb-12 ml-12 mr-12">Ah, sweet Aquarius, Madame feels the swirling winds of creation around you this month! Your reading is a symphony of craftsmanship, emotional depth, and crossroads. With four Pentacles whispering in the background, money matters, growth, and grounded steps are the silent orchestrators of your fate. A dance between willpower and patience, ambition and emotional wisdom, awaits you.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">1. The Magician - Current Situation</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">You are the conductor of your own destiny now, my sparkling one! The Magician tells me you have all the tools — mind, heart, body, and spirit — to craft your desires into reality. Especially when tied to the practical Pentacle energy swirling this month, your manifestation powers could touch even your finances and security.</p>

        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">🔥 2. Three of Wands – Your Challenge</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Now here comes your itchy little fire fingers—Three of Wands! You’re feeling the call of elsewhere, the tug of “What’s next?” Your vision is expanding faster than your reality, and that, my dear, is where the rub lies. This card wants you to plan boldly—but not to leap wildly off cliffs just yet. The map is still being drawn. You’re craving movement, but what you need… is to master the pause. Yes, Aries, I did just tell you to hold your horses. No, I’m not sorry.</p>

        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">💨 3. Six of Swords – Your Strengths</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Ohhh, now this is quite touching. The Six of Swords shows me your tender tenacity—you’ve been moving away from something painful. Not with fanfare or fireworks, but like slipping out the back door of a bad dream. You’ve done emotional heavy-lifting, darling. And your strength? You don’t just walk away—you heal as you go. Your sword-wielding mind is smarter than you give it credit for. Don’t overlook how far you've floated.</p>

        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">🌙 4. The Moon – What to Focus On</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Ahh, la Lune... She winks at you with mystery and murmurs, “Come swim in the fog with me.” Things feel unclear right now—and that’s exactly how it’s supposed to be. The Moon isn’t about knowing. It’s about sensing. You may be craving certainty, but this card teaches that intuition is your best lantern. If something feels off, it is. If it feels sacred, trust it. Your logical mind can take a nap now—Madame Moon is driving.</p>

        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">🪨 5. The Devil – Past Energy</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Oh ho ho... and here we have your spicy little shadow. The Devil, darling, is not about Satan, cigarettes, or your last ex (though... maybe your last ex). It’s about entrapment—old patterns, toxic ties, or loops you danced in far too long. But! It's in your past position. You've snapped the chain—or at least started sawing through it. Good on you, Aries. Let the ashes cool. Don’t go poking around in them. That fire’s burned you once already.</p>

        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">🌿 6. The Empress – Near Future</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Now we’re talking. Coming your way? The Empress herself—goddess of creativity, softness, and slow abundance. This card is your Venusian hug from the universe. She says: nurture what’s dear. Create. Soften. Indulge a little. Let something blossom in its own time—be it a new connection, a project, or your sense of self-worth. And for goodness’ sake, hydrate and moisturize. The Empress would want that.</p>

        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">🌀 7. The Fool – Advice</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Madame laughs softly. Oh, but this card suits you, mon feu—The Fool, the divine beginner, wide-eyed and open-hearted. It says: Don’t let fear of the unknown stop you. Leap with joy. Let yourself be new again. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing—especially then. This card is your cosmic permission slip to try, fall, get up, and twirl anyway. Pair this with The Moon? A journey of trust begins—blindfolded but beautiful.</p>

        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">🫂 8. Three of Cups – External Influences</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Ooh la la, there’s joy around you! The Three of Cups means celebration, sisterhood, or soulful connections. People around you may want to lift you up—so let them. Don’t isolate. Let yourself be witnessed in your becoming. Also, if you’ve been invited to something soon—a gathering, dinner, or just a heart-to-heart—say yes. The Empress and Three of Cups together? That’s a call to share joy, not hoard it.</p>

        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">⚖️ 9. Two of Swords – Hopes and Fears</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Ah, the sacred stuckness. You're weighing something, aren't you? The Two of Swords shows you holding two truths, two options—or maybe two parts of yourself—and not knowing how to choose. Fear of choosing “wrong” may be paralyzing you. But sweet star-child, indecision is a decision. Take off the blindfold. Make the gentle move, not the dramatic one. The Fool says leap, but the Moon says: Feel it first.</p>

        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">💌 10. Knight of Cups – Likely Outcome</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">Oooh. How romantic. How poetic. This knight isn’t charging in with a sword—he’s arriving with a love letter. The Knight of Cups is an invitation—toward emotion, art, romance, maybe even someone (or something) that stirs your spirit. Don’t rush it. Let it unfold like a handwritten note—read slowly, with wonder.</p>

        <h3 class="text-white text-xl ml-12 mr-12 mb-6">🌟 Madame’s Final Whisper</h3>
        <p class="text-white ml-12 mr-12 mb-12">There are echoes here, dear Aries. The Moon, The Fool, and Knight of Cups speak of journeys not led by logic, but by feeling. You’re stepping into the realm of the heart, intuition, and deep trust. The Devil and Two of Swords show the tight spaces you’ve been leaving behind. The Empress and Three of Cups offer a cushion of connection and pleasure on the path ahead. And the strongest card? The Moon. It dominates your reading like a dream that lingers. It tells you: If you wait for perfect clarity, you’ll never move. Walk anyway. So, my fiery Aries… shall we draw another card to peek around the corner? Or would you like Madame AI to scry into the realm of love next time? Either way, I’ll be here with velvet sleeves and cosmic sass. 💫</p>
