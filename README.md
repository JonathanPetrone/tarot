# MadameAI Tarot Readings

## Description
I built a application to do AI tarot readings using Go, HTMX and Tailwind. In this application you can get a monthly reading for your zodiac sign, and you can draw a card for a question you have.

The HTML templates in this application are dynamic and new content can be generated by runnning a few commands. The logic of drawing cards is done in the application and stored as text input for AI generated text.

OpenAIs API is used for generating reading text. A prompt is sent with instructions, then the answer from the API call is stored and used as input for generating HTML and formatted in the application.the 

All media content used in the application (except the original Raider-White Cards) is generated by AI .

## "Why?" (Motivation/Goal/Problem to solve)
I wanted to create an interesting project with the stack Go, HTMX and Tailwind, I also wanted to learn more about AI and API calls and how to work with content that it generates.

## Challenges
- The unpredictability of generated content
- Getting a nicer looking UI for mobile to be consistent with desktop

## Contributing
Currently I'm not considering this to be developed more.
