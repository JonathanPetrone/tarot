Four of Cups ‚Äì Advice\nThe Four of Cups invites you to look within the quiet corners of your heart, dear Sagittarius. It speaks to a phase where contemplation shines more than extroversion, urging introspection over indulgence. Take note of emerging dissatisfaction or emotional stagnancy‚Äîoften, lifelines offer themselves from unexpected sources.

There resides your strength amidst uncertainty, for every query contains its answer, waiting to rise.
